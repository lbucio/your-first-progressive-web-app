## Push Notifications
Two API's

### [Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API)
The Push API gives web applications the ability to receive messages pushed to them from a server, whether or not the web app is in the foreground, or even currently loaded.

### [Notification API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API)
The Notifications API allows web pages to control the display of system notifications to the end user.

## App Shell 
ðŸŽ¥[Instant Loading with the App Shell Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhUzmR8eZAo)

The app shell should ideally:

- Load fast
- Use as little data as possible
- Use static assets from a local cache
- Separate content from navigation
- Retrieve and display page-specific content (HTML, JSON, etc.)
- Optionally, cache dynamic content

Reliable performance that is consistently fast. Repeat visits are extremely quick. Static assets and the UI (e.g. HTML, JavaScript, images and CSS) are cached on the first visit so that they load instantly on repeat visits. Content may be cached on the first visit, but is typically loaded when it is needed.

Native-like interactions. By adopting the app shell model, you can create experiences with instant, native-application-like navigation and interactions.

Economical use of data. Design for minimal data usage and be judicious in what you cache because listing files that are non-essential (large images that are not shown on every page, for instance) result in browsers downloading more data than is strictly necessary. Even though data is relatively cheap in western countries, this is not the case in emerging markets where connectivity is expensive and data is costly.
